# BeeCorp

## Introduction

A demonstration of Angular with Hasura GraphQL. In it, you are able to add new bee colonies, and change the number of hives and bees in each colony.
As x amount of days pass since colony creation or since the last honey collection, the system will calculate the overproduction of honey and when you should collect the honey. 
If this amount ever exceeds 150 grams, it will notify you to add a new hive to the colony.
